Made some other guy's mobile game in Clojure.
It's my first Clojure project and making games is a great way to learn a language.

'lein run' in the project file should get you going.

I didn't use any addtional libraries for such a simple game.
Make sure your terminal is ANSI color code compliant.

I wrote this on Linux in an evening so uh...best to use Linux.
It WON'T work on Windows, then again, why are you on Windows?
Great games like this are available on Loonix.

My grandma says I'm "pretty good at computers".
